Due to the storage limits on Github, the raw data files could not be uploaded to this repository. Instead, the link to the data files will be provided below
and you may download the files individually should you want to do so. There are four files to download: 

train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz


Link to data files:       http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ 


Once downloaded place the files in a local directory named "data".
