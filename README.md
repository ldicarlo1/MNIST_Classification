# MNIST Classification
Simple project using dimensionality reduction and machine learning to classify handwritten digit images.

The MNIST dataset is a publicly available dataset that is very often used for simple classification algorithms. This is a short project that loads in the MNIST dataset, uses Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and determines a superior machine learning technique for modelling of the data. The techniques that are applied in this project are: PCA reduction, KNN, Random Forest, and Boosted Decision Trees. 

# Running the script 
In order to run the script MNIST_main.R, first the 4 data files necessary for this project need to be downloaded and stored in an approriate folder. The file data_README.txt contains the instructions to do so. 

Once the data is stored under the "data" folder, then the working directory must be set in the script MNIST_main.R. This is to ensure that the file will look in the correct location for the data necessary for the script to run.
