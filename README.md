# MNIST Classification
Simple project using dimensionality reduction and machine learning to classify handwritten digit images.

The MNIST dataset is a publicly available dataset that is very often used for simple classification algorithms. This is a short project that loads in the MNIST dataset, uses Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and determines a superior machine learning technique for modelling of the data. The techniques that are applied in this project are: PCA reduction, KNN, Random Forest, and Boosted Decision Trees.
